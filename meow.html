                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Wangmo Wangmo meow, a second-year, second-semester student at the College of Science and Technology. 
                    I have always had a strong passion for studying and an unquenchable curiosity about the world around me.
                     Whether it is exploring new topics in my field of study or diving into subjects that pique my interest, 
                     I love the process of learning and expanding my knowledge. The excitement of discovering something new
                    motivates me to push further in my academic journey. I believe that education is a lifelong process, and
                    I am always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow, both in and outside of the classroom. Exploring
                    new things—whether through research, conversations, or hands-on experiences—is something I truly cherish.</p>

                <h3>First Project: Student Details Database for Teachers</h3>
                <p>For my first project, I developed a system to help teachers easily manage student information by punching 
                    the student details into a database. The system was designed to streamline the process of storing and retrieving
                    essential data, such as student names, grades, and attendance records. By creating a user-friendly interface, 
                    I ensured that teachers could access and update the information efficiently. This project gave me valuable hands-on
                    experience with databases and data management, enhancing my understanding of how to build systems that serve real-world needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Second Project: Website for My College</h3>
                <p>For my second project, I worked on designing and developing a website for my college. The website aimed to serve as a central
                     hub for students, faculty, and prospective students to access important information about the college. I focused on creating 
                     a visually appealing, responsive design that would work well on both desktop and mobile devices. The website featured sections 
                     for course offerings, events, news, and contact information, among other essential resources. This project not only strengthened
                     my web development skills but also taught me the importance of user-centered design and accessibility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Third Project: Research on Computer Architecture</h3>
                <p>For my third project, I conducted in-depth research on computer architecture. I explored various aspects of how modern 
                    computer systems are designed, including CPU architecture, memory hierarchy, and the interaction between hardware and 
                    software. This research helped me develop a deeper understanding of the components that make up a computer system and 
                    how they work together to execute tasks efficiently. The project involved reading academic papers, analyzing case studies,
                     and presenting my findings in a comprehensive report. It was an intellectually challenging project that allowed me to 
                    delve into the technical details of computer engineering.
